# CS294-082
***Public Repository for CS 294-082 - Experimental Design for Machine Learning on Multimedia Data (Graduate) - Coursework (Spring '19)***

Hello! I'm glad you're here. Here is an overview of the project from the original report:

> "We use the VGG16Net model developed by the Visual Geometry Group at the University of Oxford and repeatedly train it on the MNIST          dataset while attempting to reduce its parameters without significantly reducing model accuracy."


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Clone the repository and create a new virtual environment on Anaconda or virtualenv (I used Anaconda) to install all the needed dependencies.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run `from deepcompressor import checker`
    `checker.ensure_background()`

## Deep Compression 

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
