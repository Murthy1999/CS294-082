# CS294-082
***Public Repository for CS 294-082 - Experimental Design for Machine Learning on Multimedia Data (Graduate) - Coursework (Spring '19)***

## Introduction
Hello! I'm glad you're here. Here is an overview of the project from the original report:

> "We use the VGG16Net model developed by the Visual Geometry Group at the University of Oxford and repeatedly train it on the MNIST          dataset while attempting to reduce its parameters without significantly reducing model accuracy."

Clone the repository create a new virtual environment (I used Anaconda, not virtualenv) and download the dependencies by

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Start by importing everything from the deepcompressor package. If this doesn't cause any errors you're all good to go!

`from deepcompressor import *'
