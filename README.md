***Public Repository for CS 294-082 - Experimental Design for Machine Learning on Multimedia Data (Graduate) - Coursework (Spring '19)***

## Introduction
Hello! I'm glad you're here. Here is an overview of the project from the original report:

> "We use the VGG16Net model developed by the Visual Geometry Group at the University of Oxford and repeatedly train it on the MNIST          dataset while attempting to reduce its parameters without significantly reducing model accuracy."

Clone the repository and navigate to the directory with requirements.txt. Start by creating a new virtual environment (I used Anaconda, not virtualenv) and downloading the dependencies by

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
